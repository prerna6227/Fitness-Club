Tech Stack: React, React Props, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript

This project is a fully responsive Fitness Club website developed using React and structured with React Props to share data between components, styled with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for layout and visual components. It represents a modern, multi-section fitness or gym landing experience designed to showcase club features, services, trainer profiles, schedules, and membership options with clear, engaging UI and smooth navigation.
